  title: "SCAIFE Prioritization Module API Definition"
  description: "This is the API definition for a SCAIFE Prioritization
  Module. SCAIFE facilitates auditing static analysis meta-alerts using
  classifiers, optional adaptive heuristics, and meta-alert
  prioritization. SCAIFE enables jump-starting labeled datasets using
  test suites. It is intended to enable a wide range of users (with
  widely varying datasets, static analysis tools, machine learning
  expertise, and amount of labeled data) to benefit from using
  classifiers and sophisticated prioritization to automatically triage
  static analysis meta-alerts."
